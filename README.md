# Omni-Arb

Omni-Arb is a lightweight skeleton for a deterministic arbitrage and directional
trading research platform. It demonstrates an end-to-end flow from opportunity
intake through risk checks, execution and logging.

## Layout

- `core/` – trading primitives
- `orchestrator/` – pipeline wiring modules together
- `nlp/` – placeholders for FinGPT/FinRAG integrations
- `research/` – backtesting utilities
- `deploy/` – docker-compose and infra helpers
- `config/` – configuration files
- `tests/` – pytest test suite

## Getting Started

```bash
make test
```
